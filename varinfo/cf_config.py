""" This module contains a class designed to read and present information from
    a JSON configuration file. This configuration file provides overriding
    information for attributes provided by granules on a per-collection basis.
    This information is primarily intended to augment the CF-Convention
    attributes for a dataset, but can also be used to alter non CF-Convention
    metadata within a granule.

    Information within the configuration file is split into rules that have
    an Applicability. This section should define a mission, collection short
    name and (optionally) a regular expression compatible string for relevant
    variable paths.

    The configuration file also specifies variables that are incorrectly
    considered as science variables by the VarInfo class, due to them having
    references in the coordinates attribute. Further, there are required
    variables that have to be included in the output of any variable subset
    request for a specific collection.
