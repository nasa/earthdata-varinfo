    "\n",
    "### What is earthdata-varinfo?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) maintained software package.\n",
    "* A Pip-installable Python package that parses granule metadata from a number of input sources.\n",
    "* Used extensively in 4 [Harmony](https://harmony.earthdata.nasa.gov) backend services (HOSS, Swath Projector, Trajectory Subsetter, Harmony Regridding Service).\n",
    "* Leans heavily on the [Climate and Forecast metadata conventions](http://cfconventions.org/).\n",
    "* Born from an effort to consolidate metadata and variable relationship parsing so that services being developed didn't have to repeat the same code.\n",
    "* First internal release 2021-03-11, first PyPI release June 2023.\n",
    "* Includes variable (UMM-Var) JSON generation support.\n",
    "* Maintained by the NASA EOSDIS Transformation Train.\n",
    "* Contributions welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parses and extracts variable metadata from within source granules.\n",
    "* Also parses relationships between variables, primarily using dimension information or CF-Convention attributes expected to contain such information.\n",
    "* Variable classification via CF-Convention-based heuristics (e.g., using `units` and other attributes).\n",
    "* Metadata can be supplemented or overwritten with a configuration file (which has a fully defined JSON schema).\n",
    "* Extensible for further input formats (uses abstract base classes).\n",
    "* Common Metadata Repository ([CMR](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/cmr)) compliant UMM-Var JSON generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to install earthdata-varinfo\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install earthdata-varinfo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If this doesn't work, alternatively you can clone the [git repository](https://github.com/nasa/earthdata-varinfo), and install the package in editable mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/nasa/earthdata-varinfo\n",
    "cd earthdata-varinfo\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other notebook requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "When installing `earthdata-varinfo` via PyPI required packages should automatically be installed as dependencies. For local development, without a standard pip installation, third party requirements can be installed from the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt -r dev-requirements.txt\n",
    "pip install notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input formats\n",
    "\n",
    "* OPeNDAP Dataset Metadata Response files (DMR).\n",
    "* NetCDF-4 files (can also parse HDF-5 files, with varying success regarding variable relationships).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current output format\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently `earthdata-varinfo` produces Python classes that can be used within Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks or a Python Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL).\n",
    "\n",
    "`earthdata-varinfo` is also able to create UMM-Var compliant JSON records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**VarInfoFromNetCDF4 and VarInfoFromDMR:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main parent classes that represents the contents of a granule. It contains dictionaries of variable instances, and class methods to retrieve variables (e.g., \"required variables\" for a given set of requested variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "**VariableFromNetCDF4 and VariableFromDMR:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A representation of a single granule. Extracts metadata attributes from the input source and fully qualifies references to other variables (to allow determination of relationships with other variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "**CFConfig:**\n",
    "\n",
    "One instance of `CFConfig` is associated with a single `VarInfoFromDMR` or `VarInfoFromNetCDF4` object. When declaring those classes, a short name is either supplied or searched for in the granule metadata. The `CFConfig` instance then retrieves any rules from the specified configuration file that apply to that collection and/or mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "When each individual variable is parsed, any applicable rules from the configuration file are used to, for example, update metadata attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Granules used:\n",

    "* [GPM_3IMERGHH](https://cmr.uat.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/G1256265181-EEDTEST.umm_json)\n",
    "* [GEDI L4A](https://cmr.uat.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/G1245557637-EEDTEST.umm_json)\n",
    "\n",
